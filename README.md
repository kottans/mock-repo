<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<p>My name is Artem. 
I am 35 years old. 
I work as an engineer in the field of telecommunications.</p>
<br>
<p>I used to study a little:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML 5</li> 
  <li>CSS 3</li> 
  <li>Python 3</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>As part of the first assignment, I listened to the lectures of the first and second weeks of the course Introduction to Git and GitHub. 

While listening to lectures, I realized that the topic of Git is much deeper and more extensive than I had previously imagined. I will continue studying. I am sure that I will use it in my future work on projects.

Also played the game on learngitbranching.js.org.
This game seemed a bit difficult to me.</p>
