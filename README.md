# Git and GitHub

It was an explosive start to front-end learning! At first it was hard for me because of English)) but with each lesson it became easier and easier to learn. I really liked the Git tool, and I will definitely use it in my studies, work and my projects. Many thanks to Kottans for the great course. I'm moving on to the next Linux, Command Line, HTTP tools!)

## Hello fellows!
My name is Myhkailo, I have been living in Kharkiv for 10 years though I was born in the Kyiv Oblast and spent most of my life in the Poltava Oblast.
I took an HTML&CSS course in Spalah IT School about five years ago. I stopped developing at that point because another career found me then. Now I see that it was a bad move, so now I want to correct that mistake and to finally fulfill my old dream – become a front-end developer. Hopefully, this course will help me to make a great stride towards my endeavor :)
