# Hi there!

## Interesting fact about cats :)

The whiskers on a cat aren‚Äôt just cute, they serve a very important function in assisting cats with getting around, especially at night. Whiskers are embedded deep in the cat‚Äôs body and are connected to the cat‚Äôs sensitive muscular and nervous systems, acting as touch receptors (or a ‚Äúkitty radar‚Äù). Whiskers allow a cat to detect and respond to changes in their surroundings.

I`m Alex: https://github.com/Rybchynskyi/

Its my repo repository for kottans

My first expression about Git:
Actually, i think that git is the most important think in teamwork. It`s like time-mashine ‚è±, that can move you in past statement of the project.

I can`t imaging how developers worked before git was deweloped üòµ‚Äçüí´

The most important think that I understand, is that you can make many branches. And in each branch you can code new features for the main project.

I thtink that I will use not all commands that I learned. But i must understand this commands for sure.
Because if you dont understand philosofy of git - yoy can make many mistakes in deployment.

Espetialy thanks for the selection of learning materials.
Because today we have many courses about deployment in internet. But not all of them are useful and understandable.
Great and importand job üëç

Let`s continue. Good luck everyone

Hello!

My name is Serhii!

I hope I can find here that will motivate me to reach the end! Good luck everyone and Glory to Ukraine!

I'm happy to be with kottans
(https://github.com/kottans/git-course)

# Hello i'm Iryna) My impressions of studying the material:

The first request will be in the form of a course. It was necessary to independently review the theoretical material in the form of video and text material. The videos were short and very clear. This part was the easiest for me, because I was already theoretically familiar with this material. The second part was in the form of a simulator, which helped to practically master this knowledge. It was more difficult, the tasks became more difficult with each successive one, but it helped a lot to understand how everything works in practice. GIT knowledge will be 100% essential in real work environment in my opinion.

It was an explosive start to front-end learning! At first it was hard for me because of English)) but with each lesson it became easier and easier to learn. I really liked the Git tool, and I will definitely use it in my studies, work and my projects. Many thanks to Kottans for the great course.

## Hello fellows!

My name is Myhkailo, I have been living in Kharkiv for 10 years though I was born in the Kyiv Oblast and spent most of my life in the Poltava Oblast.
I took an HTML&CSS course in Spalah IT School about five years ago. I stopped developing at that point because another career found me then. Now I see that it was a bad move, so now I want to correct that mistake and to finally fulfill my old dream ‚Äì become a front-end developer. Hopefully, this course will help me to make a great stride towards my endeavor :)

# Hello, Kottans!

Hello! My name is Tania. I want to be a Frontend developer. I hope that this course helps me to achieve the goal.

## Git Basics

I studied the materials of the course Introduction to Git and GitHub on Coursera.

Before I used some basic Git's comands and know how to work with it locally and remotes, but on this course, I discovered some new topics:

- prehistory of creating VCS
- detailed information about the basic Git workflow (when in each repository we have a Git directory, a working tree, and a staging area)
- pull requests.

Then I had some practice in the learngitbranching.js.org (basis and Push & Pull - remote repositories in Git!). These tasks were very usefull to understanding how the git works.

So in the future I'll be used git in my projects.

## Hello everyone!

My name's Daria and I'm excited to learn new things from the course. Wish we all complete this challenge :)
Here is my [repo](https://github.com/d-pozniak/kottans-frontend), you can check it out.
