# Git and GitHub

It was an explosive start to front-end learning! At first it was hard for me because of English)) but with each lesson it became easier and easier to learn. I really liked the Git tool, and I will definitely use it in my studies, work and my projects. Many thanks to Kottans for the great course. I'm moving on to the next Linux, Command Line, HTTP tools!)
