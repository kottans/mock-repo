Hi,

This is a training repository for Kottans [frontend](https://github.com/Kottans/frontend),
[backend](https://github.com/Kottans/backend),
and [git](https://github.com/Kottans/git-course) courses. 
You can try sending pull-requests to this repository proposing a change.
The change can be anything you like, for example: fixing a typo in README.md. Consider this phrase, for example:

*This was an intentionaly mispelld phrase*

Tell other kottans a couple of words and add a fancy picture.

Try it! It’s fun, we promise :)

**Please, add your greetings at the end of file.**

By the way, creating issues is fun too!

**NB!**
- **Your pull-request may not be reviewed very quickly, please have patience.**
- **If you need help with a PR (e.g. resolving merge conflict) ask the community for support**
  **posting a message `#help_wanted` + link to your pull request**

# Git and GitHub

It was an explosive start to front-end learning! At first it was hard for me because of English)) but with each lesson it became easier and easier to learn. I really liked the Git tool, and I will definitely use it in my studies, work and my projects. Many thanks to Kottans for the great course. I'm moving on to the next Linux, Command Line, HTTP tools!)
