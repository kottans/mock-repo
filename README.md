my impressons of learning Git:

First of all, I would like to appreciate learngitbranching.js.org this website. It's very easy-using and including comprehensive knowledge of Git.

For the process of learning Fit, the Rebase part confuse me the most. Besides practicing the test developed by the website, I also searched informaion online got to know more clear about this concept.

Another thing is it took more time to learn this tool as I estimated. I thought I could complete all the levels within 2 days, it turnes out tooks me about 3 days to finish them.

Action is better than words, let's start my 1st pull-request to make me get more familiar with this tool!
