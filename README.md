Hi,

This is a training repository for both [Kottans web course](https://github.com/Kottans/web) and [Kottans frontend course](https://github.com/Kottans/frontend). You can try sending pull-requests to this repository proposing a change.
The change can be anything you like, for example: fixing a typo in README.md. Consider this phrase, for example:

*This was an intentionally misspelled phrase*

Try it! It’s fun, we promise :)

By the way, creating issues is fun too!

**NB! Your pull-request may not be reviewed very quickly, please have patience.**

If you are impatient use
[web course chat](https://gitter.im/Kottans/web?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
or [frontend course chat](https://gitter.im/Kottans/frontend)
with other to make fun from conversation.

Hi)  
My name is Lisa and now I'm not scared about using git  
But I was  
And it is really exciting for me because  I  often heard smt like "I make a commitment" but don't understand how it works  
And this small thing gives me filing like I can learn anything that I don't have before  
So I'm really gratful your community for this inspiration and I hope that I have a chance to continue my education with you <3
