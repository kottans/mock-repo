_Всем привет, меня зовут Сергей, я из Украины и я только начинаю учить ___frontend___. В первую очередь я хочу поблагодарить вас за такую возможность, возможность пройти ваш курс бесплатно. Так же я извиняюсь за свой русский, если это не проблема, то я продолжу описывать свои уроки на русском, поскольку с украинским у меня не все так просто, а английский я только вот недавно начал изучать._

___P.S. Слава Україні - героям слава!___

Было очень интересно изучать __Git__ и __GitHub__.

На видео курсах первой и второй недели __Coursera__, а так же на практических занятиях сайта [https://learngitbranching.js.org/](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) я узнал много интересного:

* сейчас для меня все в новинку. Сам __Git__ - является для меня чем-то новым,неизведанным. Но все же, допустим команда __git init__, команда с помощью которой я научился создавать репозиторий на своем компьютере
* удивила команда __git cherry-pick__
* __git init, git clone, git status__ - их, и многие другие я буду точно использовать в будущем

# Hi there!

## Interesting fact about cats :)
The whiskers on a cat aren’t just cute, they serve a very important function in assisting cats with getting around, especially at night. Whiskers are embedded deep in the cat’s body and are connected to the cat’s sensitive muscular and nervous systems, acting as touch receptors (or a “kitty radar”). Whiskers allow a cat to detect and respond to changes in their surroundings.

# Hello Kottans!
# Hi All!
Good day. 10/10 for the initial training material I went through in this training course. Previously, I worked a little with the Git version control system, but before going through the training materials, it was, frankly, extremely confusing. Theoretically, everything has become much clearer, but we will further consolidate everything in practice.

## Hi there!
Good luck everyone :raised_hands:

Hello!

# Добрий день eyerybody 👋
I`m Alex: https://github.com/Rybchynskyi/

Its my repo repository for kottans

My first expression about Git:
Actually, i think that git is the most important think in teamwork. It`s like time-mashine ⏱, that can move you in past statement of the project.

I can`t imaging how developers worked before git was deweloped 😵‍💫

The most important think that I understand, is that you can make many branches. And in each branch you can code new features for the main project.

I thtink that I will use not all commands that I learned. But i must understand this commands for sure.
Because if you dont understand philosofy of git - yoy can make many mistakes in deployment.

Espetialy thanks for the selection of learning materials.
Because today we have many courses about deployment in internet. But not all of them are useful and understandable.
Great and importand job 👍

Let`s continue. Good luck everyone

Hello!

# Hi! I'm Anna. I am incredibly excited to study with Kottans.

Hi! I'm Pavlo and I learn GitHub.
I'm happy to be with kottans
(https://github.com/kottans/git-course)

# Hello i'm Iryna) My impressions of studying the material:

The first request will be in the form of a course. It was necessary to independently review the theoretical material in the form of video and text material. The videos were short and very clear. This part was the easiest for me, because I was already theoretically familiar with this material. The second part was in the form of a simulator, which helped to practically master this knowledge. It was more difficult, the tasks became more difficult with each successive one, but it helped a lot to understand how everything works in practice. GIT knowledge will be 100% essential in real work environment in my opinion.

## Hi everyone 🙃

I'm Olena. I’m excited to join the kottans community. First of all, I wanna thank the organizers and developers for the opportunity to take this course. I hope I'll be able to complete all the tasks and continue my studies at the next levels.

# Git and GitHub

It was an explosive start to front-end learning! At first it was hard for me because of English)) but with each lesson it became easier and easier to learn. I really liked the Git tool, and I will definitely use it in my studies, work and my projects. Many thanks to Kottans for the great course. I'm moving on to the next Linux, Command Line, HTTP tools!)

## Hello fellows!

My name is Myhkailo, I have been living in Kharkiv for 10 years though I was born in the Kyiv Oblast and spent most of my life in the Poltava Oblast.
I took an HTML&CSS course in Spalah IT School about five years ago. I stopped developing at that point because another career found me then. Now I see that it was a bad move, so now I want to correct that mistake and to finally fulfill my old dream – become a front-end developer. Hopefully, this course will help me to make a great stride towards my endeavor :)

## Git Basics

I studied the materials of the course Introduction to Git and GitHub on Coursera.


Before I used some basic Git's comands and know how to work with it locally and remotes, but on this course, I discovered some new topics:

 		* prehistory of creating VCS
 		* detailed information about the basic Git workflow (when in each repository we have a Git directory, a working tree, and a staging area)
 		* pull requests.

Then I had some practice in the learngitbranching.js.org (basis and Push & Pull - remote repositories in Git!). These tasks were very usefull to understanding how the git works.


So in the future I'll be used git in my projects.


## Hello everyone!

## Hello everybody
Всім привіт!
Пройшла курс "Version control with GIT" на Udacity, потім 2 тижні "Introduction to Git" від Google. Це було моє перше знайомство з Git. Гадаю, добре, що почала саме з Udacity, там метеріал подають більш доступно і наочно.Потім перейшла до learngitbranching, дуже цікаво, ніби вчишся граючись. То була однозначно чудова задумка створити такий сайт) Загалом все зрозуміло. Поки що трохи плутаюсь, але, впевнена, що це через брак практики і з часом в голові все стане на місце.

## Hello 😃

Learning is very interesting. There are difficult tasks, but after you complete them, your mood rises.

Git was completely new to me.)

On the courses, I was surprised by the fact that it is possible to clone repositories. I was also surprised by how the Putty program works

So I will definitely use Linux in the future.

Thank you very much for the opportunity to study.
Good luck with your studies  to everyone.👌

I want to share my impressions about the learned material. Initially, when I started watching the first video, I was frustrated because I couldn’t understand anything, I expected to hear how to write code, and they began to explain what Git is. Since I am new to this field, it was difficult for me to get up to speed. It took me a long time to look through the courses, complete the assignments, and eventually master this topic. I really liked the courses: accessible, understandable, convenient. Now I understand what GIt and GitHub are, and I understand that writing good and clean code is great, but you also need to be able to work with this code and together with the team.
