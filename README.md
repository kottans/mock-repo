Hi, kottans! Nice to meet you!

##### H E L L O!

:smirk_cat:

This is a training repository for both [Kottans web course](https://github.com/Kottans/web) and [Kottans frontend course](https://github.com/Kottans/frontend). You can try sending pull-requests to this repository proposing a change.
The change can be anything you like, for example: fixing a typo in README.md. Consider this phrase, for example:

_This is an internationally missspelled phprase_

Tell other kottans a couple of words and add a fancy picture.

Try it! It’s fun, we promise :)

By the way, creating issues is fun too!

# Hi, Kottans-Frontend Club!

<br>
Nice to meet you! I'm Peter. Thank you for opportunity to learn this course and to communicate with others.
I have interested Udacity git course especially for building excelent concept map of Git.
I have enjoyed course *try.githab.io* for studying materials, such as *learning git
branching* with graphical view of git commits as a tree, *github learning lab* with interactive activities.
