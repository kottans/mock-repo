Hi,

This is a training repository for Kottans [frontend](https://github.com/Kottans/frontend),
[frontend](https://github.com/Kottans/backend),
and [git](https://github.com/Kottans/git-course) courses. 
You can try sending pull-requests to this repository proposing a change.
The change can be anything you like, for example: fixing a typo in README.md. Consider this phrase, for example:

*This was an intentionaly mispelld phrase*

Tell other kottans a couple of words and add a fancy picture.

Try it! It’s fun, we promise :)

**Please, add your greetings at the end of file.**

By the way, creating issues is fun too!

**NB!**
 - **Your pull-request may not be reviewed very quickly, please have patience.**
 - **If you need help with a PR (e.g. resolving merge conflict) ask the community for support**

# Git and GitHub

It was an explosive start to front-end learning! At first it was hard for me because of English)) but with each lesson it became easier and easier to learn. I really liked the Git tool, and I will definitely use it in my studies, work and my projects. Many thanks to Kottans for the great course. I'm moving on to the next Linux, Command Line, HTTP tools!)

Greet everyone on this incredible cource!!!
