Hi,

This is a training repository for both [Kottans web course](https://github.com/Kottans/web) and [Kottans frontend course](https://github.com/Kottans/frontend). You can try sending pull-requests to this repository proposing a change.
The change can be anything you like, for example: fixing a typo in README.md. Consider this phrase, for example:


*This is an internationally missspelled phprase*

Tell other kottans a couple of words and add a fancy picture.

Try it! It’s fun, we promise :)

By the way, creating issues is fun too!
